The application admin would like the capability to single click accept/reject logic when validating documents on the document request list (DRL).

When the application admin clicks VIEW for that specific DRL line item, they would like a browser to open with the document displayed and 2 options available.

clicking ACCEPT should update the document verified flag for the line item and close out the document in the browser.

clicking REJECT should delete the attachment, notify the resource that the document was rejected and needs to be re-uploaded, and close out the document in the browser.
above is for admin

The application admin can assign document requests to a resource and assign a due date from the Document Request List (DRL) section of the International Tax Credit main page.

An email goes out to the assigned resource notifying them of the assignment and due date.

A hyperlink to the specific tax credit is provided in the email.

When the link is clicked, it returns the tax credit main page and the resource needs to select what document to upload.  This is a possible failure point where a resource may select and incorrectly upload a document to an incorrect line item on the DRL.

The business would like the capability where the hyperlink in the email notification only allows uploads to that assigned document type for that resource for that tax credit.

The business would like to limit the possible failure point of a resource incorrectly picking a document type for upload.

Question:  Is there a way to limit the possible version(document types) to only those that were assigned to that resource on that tax credit?
